1. we can read the log
2. iterate and calculate runtimes and add run_number column

Next steps 
- calculate 
    - for each run
        - overall wall-clock run time
        - longest running job
        - jobs longer than 10 mins
    - overall 40 runs
        - total run time
        - longest running job
        - jobs longer than 10 mins
        - for jobs longer than 10 mins is there any over lap 
            time wise that might be the bottle neck
